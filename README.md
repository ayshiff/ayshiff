Hi ðŸ‘‹   
I am **RÃ©mi Doreau**, a french FullStack Developer passionated about the Software Engineering world.   
Every two weeks I choose a contribution to Open Source that I made during these two weeks that I find quite complete and particularly interesting to present in <a href="http://myopensourcejourney.com/">**My Open Source journey**</a>.

I also have a <a href="https://remidoreau.com/">**blog**</a> where you can find various articles about programming. 

You can find most of my work on <a href="https://github.com/ayshiff/">**GitHub**</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/ayshiff">**GitLab**</a>.   

In my free time I love doing **algorithms** and **competitive programming**.
